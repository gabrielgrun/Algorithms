# Advanced algorithms in Java

This project was made during the classes of course "Recursion, Backtracking and Dynamic Programming in Java" from teacher Holczer Balazs.

Here, I show some of the algorithms that I learned from the classes.

Enjoy it and feel free to fork and modify the algorithms! :smile:
